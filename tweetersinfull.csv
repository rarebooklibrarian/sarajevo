It was organized in 1904 and incorporated in 1927 with the principal objectives of promoting bibliographical research and issuing bibliographical publications. These objectives have been and continue to be accomplished through a broad array of activities, including meetings, lectures, and fellowship programs, as well as the publishing of books and the Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America (PBSA), North America’s leading bibliographical journal. The Society is open to all those interested in bibliographical problems and projects, and its membership includes bibliographers, librarians, professors, students, booksellers, and collectors worldwide.  The Council and Officers of the BSA voted unanimously on 31 October 2020 to approve the Equity Action Plan. Visit that page on our website, and read this announcement, for further details. Mission  The Bibliographical Society of America is an international, interdisciplinary scholarly organization that fosters the study of books and other textual artifacts in traditional and emerging formats. BSA pursues this mission by hosting public programs, funding scholarly research, conferring awards, issuing publications, and collaborating with related organizations. The Society is committed to adopting policies and procedures that support and promote equity and inclusion in all of our programs, and to providing equal access to our events and electronic resources to people with disabilities and other access needs. Values  We are committed to the field of bibliography as a critical interpretive framework for understanding books and other textual artifacts, and to bibliography’s enduring relevance to textual analysis.  We value the study of bibliography and the integration of bibliographical knowledge in a variety of academic, professional, and public settings.  We respect the legacy of bibliographical scholarship, while embracing new methods and new approaches. We encourage the application of bibliographical theory and principles to diverse materials and media.  We pursue collaborative, interdisciplinary relationships with cognate professional, scholarly, and bibliophilic organizations.  The Bibliographical Society of America seeks to build a community that embraces academic and non-academic constituencies, students, junior scholars, and senior researchers and all those interested in material texts. All are welcome as members of the Society, on its Council, committees, and working groups, and as beneficiaries of or participants in its varied programs regardless of (in alphabetical order) ability, age, citizenship status, ethnicity, gender, gender expression and identity, income level, nationality, physical appearance, race, religion, sexual orientation, or technical experience.

In doing so, we renew our commitment to combating institutionalized racism by prioritizing our collecting efforts on resources that document the underrepresented histories of Black, Indigenous and People of Color; collaborating more closely with representatives from these communities; centering these voices in our exhibit content, social media communications, and other teaching and learning initiatives; and increasing our efforts to educate ourselves and diversify our staff. Embedding practices that work to dismantle structural racial injustice is our shared responsibility as librarians, archivists, and library workers.  This commitment aligns with the University’s Race and Equity Initiative and the UW Libraries’ 2018-2023 Strategic Directions to enhance equitable environments for research, learning and working and to grow as a learning organization. In particular, we continuously strive to elevate the voices of historically underrepresented communities at UW and in the Pacific Northwest by partnering to create, preserve and increase access to culturally-relevant information resources. We believe that Black history is our history, and we must not waver in our resolve to ensure that this history is represented in Special Collections. Black history matters. Black lives matter.    Volunteer/Internship Opportunities  We welcome volunteers and interns to assist us in our work. If you are interested in learning more about opportunities available in Special Collections please fill out the form below and we will be in contact."
