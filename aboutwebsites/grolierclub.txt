About the Library

THE GROLIER CLUB OF NEW YORK
Has fostered interest in the book arts for over one hundred years, through exhibitions, publications, lectures, and—perhaps most importantly—through the formation of a research Library devoted to the arts of the book.

Founded in 1884 as a cooperative reference library for the Club's bibliophile membership, the Grolier Club Library today welcomes any qualified researcher needing to explore this focused research collection of more than 100,000 volumes on the art and history of the book: bibliographies, histories of printing and graphic processes, type specimens, and fine and historic examples of printing, binding, and illustration. The Grolier Club Library has particularly strong holdings in the literature of collecting and the book trade, including book catalogues of all types—printed and manuscript inventories of private libraries, catalogues of antiquarian booksellers, and book auction sales. The Grolier Club Library collections of book catalogues are among the most comprehensive in the US, and these, along with the papers of important bibliophiles, bibliographers, and antiquarian book dealers, have long been recognized as an important resource for collectors and scholars in book history. A detailed survey of the collections of the Grolier Club Library can be found in Lasting Impressions: The Grolier Club Library, published to accompany the exhibition held at the Club May 11-July 31, 2004. An online version of the exhibition may be viewed here.
