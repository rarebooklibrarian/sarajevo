About Special Collections
Special Collections & University Archives
We connect people with the knowledge available in unique and rare resources. We work to preserve and share the history and culture of UNC Charlotte and the Charlotte region. 
Our collections include manuscripts (the personal archives of individuals and families as well as those of local organizations), the university's records, rare and unique books, maps, local government documents, and oral history recordings. We also work collaboratively with the community to document the continual growth and change of our city.
These resources cannot be checked out, but they are available for use in the Dalton Reading Room on the 10th floor of the library.  We are open to the public, and everyone is welcome. We offer reference help and instruction services. Some of our collections are digital and are available online.
We also manage the library's state and federal government documents, which are available on the third floor of the library.
Our History
The Special Collections unit was established in 1973 to care for J. Murrey Atkins Library's rare books and manuscript collections and University Archives. The organization of the unit was stimulated by a substantial gift by local businessman, bibliophile, and art collector Harry L. Dalton for the purchase of rare books. In 2015, our name was changed to Special Collections and University Archives in order to raise awareness of our role as stewards of our institution’s records and history.
