Strategic Goal 4: FacilitiesLSU’s main library is the most important academic building on campus because of the synergies it affords students: it gives them comfortable places to study, surrounded by the collections required for their assignments, computing support, and staff available to provide a variety of academic support on an ad-hoc basis. All of this in a building that is conveniently located, open long hours, and safe.This much has been always been true, but LSU’s proposed new library will amplify this impact immeasurably. It will afford ample spaces that do a better job of accommodating today’s class assignments, public speaking, advanced technologies, fluency with multi-modal content and content creation tools. Meeting these new facility demands will also drive transformational changes in library staffing, collections, and services, rendering the next LSU library a far more visible and impactful organization.

Strategic Goal 6: PhilanthropyThe LSU Libraries has a proud history of support from those who have benefited from its services and wished to pass that experience forward to future generations. It is due to decades of such support that LSU Libraries Special Collections now ranks among the world’s most important repositories of natural history, Southern historical, and cultural material. Key to these efforts has been the Friends of the LSU Libraries group, which has contributed more than $2.5 million over the 40 years of their existence. These important accomplishments happened in the absence of staffing or systematic organizational support for fundraising.  All that has now changed decisively, resulting in strong prospects for unprecedented donor support.
